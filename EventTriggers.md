# Minecraft Legends Event Triggers
Event Triggers give entities life by allowing them to react to changes in gameplay state. Things like animations, audio, particles are driven through event triggers.

## Animation
Set the animation state on the entity which has the `badger:presentation_event` component.

Example: 
```
"range_ability_a": {  
    "animation": "range_ability_a"  
}
```

## Audio
Play a sound effect at the position of the entity which has the `badger:presentation_event` component.

We can specify music to play by setting `is_music` to `true`. Music can also have a type (`"combat","cinematic","exploration","proximity"`). The reason for the type is that we can set audio parameters on music as well. Each type can have it's own set of parameters, but be careful and make sure to reset your music parameters per type when you want to use it.

Example:  

```
"on_construction_start": {  
    "audio": "BAE_STRUC_Generic_BuildSequence"  
}
```

For music:  
```
"on_piglin_combat_start": {  
    "audio": {  
        "event": "BAE_MUS_Piglin_Combat",  
        "is_music": true,  
        "music_type": "combat"  
    }  
},
```

## External Audio
Lists of Audio Presentation Events can be defined in separate files and then used in any entity by adding the `external_audio_events` type.

External Presentation Event lists are defined in files by using the `badger:external_audio_presentation_events` component.

Here is an example of the `on_hero_lured` presentation event being defined in a new JSON file inside the `badger:mob_skeleton` list (NOTE: The list name does not need to match the entity it will be used on):

```
{
    "badger:external_audio_presentation_events" : {
        "badger:mob_skeleton": {
            "on_hero_lured":{
                "audio": "BAE_test_oneshot_3d"
            }
        }
    },
    "format_version" : "1.0.0"
}
```

External lists can then be referenced in an entity's `badger:presentation_events` component by using the `external_audio_events` type and specifying an `external_event_list` to be imported.

Here is an example of the `badger:mob_skeleton` list being imported into the `badger:mob_skeleton` entity's presentation events:

```
   "badger:presentation_event": {
       "external_audio_events": {
           "external_event_list": "badger:mob_skeleton"
       },
       "intense_hit": {
           "audio": "BAE_mob_skeleton_dx_rps_notifies_intense_hit"
       }
    }
```

## Entity
Spawn a new entity on the client or server. The new entity's position and team is copied from the entity which has the `badger:presentation_event` component.

You can also spawn multiple entities with an array: `"entity": ["badger:mob_zombie", "badger:piglin_runt", "badger:mob_wolf"]`

Example:
```
"on_world_hit": {  
    "entity": "badger:pres_entity_test"  
}
```

## Particles
Play a particle effect on the entity which has the `badger:presentation_event` component.

Example:
```
"on_initialized": {  
    "particles": {  
        "effect": "fx_trail",  
        "locator": "loc_fx_tip",  
        "enabled": true,  
        "bind_to_actor": true  
    }

"on_world_hit": {  
    "particles": "fx_impact"
```

If you want to call more then one effect on a presentation event use this syntax: 

```
"on_construction_end": {  
    "particles": [  
        {  
            "effect": "badger:fx_creeper_death",  
            "enabled": true  
        },  
        {  
            "effect": "badger:fx_block_butterflies",  
            "enabled": true  
        }  
    ]  
}
```

## Script
Calls a script on the entity which has the  `badger:presentation_event` component.

Example:
```
"event_scripts": {  
    "melee_attack_a": "variable.attack_used = 1;",  
    "melee_attack_b": "variable.attack_used = 2;"  
}
```

```
"badger:presentation_event": {  
    "on_melee_attack_a": {  
    "script": "melee_attack_a"  
}
```

## Outline
Set the outline color on the entity which has the `badger:presentation_event` component.

Example:

```
"on_lured": {  
    "outline": {  
        "color": 4, // an index into the outline colors array defined in PostFX.dragonfx (0 = None, 1 = Teammate, 2 = Enemy, 3 = Directed, 4 = Lured)
        "duration": 2.0 // the seconds to display the outline for before it disappears (don't define this field, or set it to -1.0 to make it last forever)
    }
}
```
